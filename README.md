Ready to begin Python fundamentals for ML


🚀 Day 3 of My AI/ML Journey – Logic is Getting Stronger

Today was intense.
Moved beyond basics and stepped deeper into real programming logic.

📌 What I covered today (Python Fundamentals – Part 2):

✅ Conditional Statements (if-else)
✅ Nested Conditions
✅ Match-Case in Python
✅ While & For Loops
✅ Break & Continue
✅ range() Function
✅ Multiplication Table of N
✅ Sum of N Numbers
✅ Vowel Count Program
✅ Functions in Python
✅ Types of Functions
✅ Lambda Functions
✅ Factorial Program

This is where coding stops being syntax…
and starts becoming problem-solving.

Understanding loops and functions changed the way I think about logic.
Every program today felt like a small mental workout. 🧠💻

No skipping fundamentals.
No rushing to Machine Learning models.
Building strong logic first.

AI/ML Engineer in progress. 🚀
